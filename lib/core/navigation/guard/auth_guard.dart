/// [AuthGuard] is a custom route guard for managing navigation based on the authentication status of the user.

/// When a user attempts to navigate to a protected route, this guard checks the authentication status and either allows the
/// navigation or redirects the user to the login page if they are not logged in.

  /// - If the user is logged in, navigation is allowed by calling [resolver.next(true)].
